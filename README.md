# Solana-NFT-burn-for-FT
Burn solana nft, to recieve fungible token, can be used for mint tokens, or just to give SPL tokens for burning (fee can be added)

this is a simple program built off of the solana scaffold, this program allows you to burn nfts from a collection to recieve an SPL token payment, this can be used if you are burning X amount of NFTs to mint a single nft.

1 replace <endpoint> with your endpoint
add private key to env
change <update_auth> sections with your collection update authority
replace <mint_token> with the token to be paid for burning. 

a working demo can be viewed at https://nauts.soldrop.io/ (mint tokens recieved are no longer valid as the project minted months ago)
